Worker threads in Node.js provide a way to perform CPU-intensive tasks in parallel, utilizing multiple cores and improving overall performance. They enable asynchronous and concurrent execution of code, allowing you to leverage the full power of your hardware.

In your code, the deleteNotifications function creates a worker thread using Worker from the worker_threads module. The worker thread executes the deletion process in the background without blocking the main thread. Once the deletion is completed, it sends a message back to the main thread using parentPort.postMessage, indicating the success and the number of deleted notifications.

By using worker threads, you achieve parallelism and concurrency in your application, ensuring that CPU-intensive tasks like deletion operations do not hinder the responsiveness of your server.
